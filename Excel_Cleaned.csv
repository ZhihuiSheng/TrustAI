This study is part of a class project for PSYC 111B at UC San Diego, led by Ethan Hurwitz. The data collected will be anonymous and will not be attached to your name. The study will only be shared within the context of PSYC 111B, and therefore does not merit review by UCSD's Institutional Review Board (https://irb.ucsd.edu/Research_or_not.pdf). However, the students and teaching team have done their best to ensure that the experimental protocol follows the board's guidelines. There is no compensation for participating and you may quit the experiment at any time. Please feel free to contact Ethan Hurwitz at ehurwitz@ucsd.edu if you have any questions.

It helps us understand and respond appropriately to the emotions of others.

Therefore, understanding the role of the amygdala in emotional processing and memory formation is critical for developing effective treatments for these conditions.

",70,70,"To figure out the y-coordinate of the point where a line parallel to y equals 4x plus 6 intersects the Y-axis, we can use the fact that parallel lines have the same slope. The slope of a given line is 4. So the slope of this parallel line is also 4. We can write the equation for parallel lines in slope-intercept form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. We already know the slope m is equal to 4, so we just have to figure out the y-intercept b. Given a point on the parallel lines (0,6) and plugging these values into the equation, we can solve for b:6 = 4 * 0 + bb = 6 So the equation for the parallel lines is y = 4x + 6. To find the y coordinate of the point where the line intersects the Y-axis, let x = 0 and find y:y = 4 * 0 + 6y = 6 Therefore, the y coordinate of the point where the line intersects the Y-axis is 6.",71,69,"consumer behavior.
